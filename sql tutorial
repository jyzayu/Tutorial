sql_store
Tables: where we store our data
View : Virtual Cable combine data from multiple tables and put them in aview
and this is especially pwerful for creating reports,
Stored procedures ,Functions:
program we stored inside of our database for querying data..
you  can have a store procedure for getting all the customers in  a given city
so we call that procedure and give me all the customer in san fransisco

Tables-customers is the only place that we need to modify.
we dont have to modify Tables-orders too . we use only customer-id
this is how these databases work we refer to this db rdb
we have multiple database which related each other.
customer-id column in orders table, is related to customers table

how to retrieve data from a single ponel. navigator panel there;s no bold letter
it means none of these databases are selected for query
first step to rate a query to get data from a db is to select a db
the query that well write will be executed against db
USE sql_store to use this db and execute script  or double click the db to select db
query to retrieve all customers in this db: 

SELECT customer_id  (specify the columns that we want to retrieve
or all the column using SELECT *
FROM customers:specify table that we want to query
select all the customers id in given table(customers)
use ; endpoint. when use multiple statement

WHERE customer_id=1 : to filter the result and get the customer with ID 1
we can sort the data by using ORDER BY clause , specify column we're going to sort
-- : coment line
we cannot change the order of these clauses otherwise we get syntax error
SELECT
FROM
WHERE
ORDER BY
we dont have to write clause in new line you can put SELECT * FROM customers all in one line, 
because whitespace ,line breaks and tabs are ignored
and that's perfectly acceptable for simple query  ( SELECT * FROM customers)
but as your queries get more complex, it's better to put each clause on a new line'
