comment shortcut : ctrl + shift +/
src >main>resources
application.properties :  where we configure all the properties for our application
when we connect to a real database
static and templates  : when you are doing web development such as html css js and
 all of that

main>java>demoapplication
when run program it doesnt work
then
open the pom.xml  where we have the springboot starter data jpa
and comment this dependency
then
right click on the pom.xml and click Maven and then click reload project

run demoapplication and go google and go address localhost:8080
go see whitelabel error page   error 404 it's not found 
so back to intellij  and click red square on left side of terminal to stop the server

once we ready to connect our database we will add comment dependency
close pom.xml and demoapplicationtest

in DemoApplication.java 
add @RestController  add publioc String hello(){  return "Hello World"; }
we want to get something out from our server
in order for this method to be served as arestful endpoint we have to annotate(주석달다)
 (주서거럼 코드에 달아 클래스에 특별한 의미를 부여하거나 기능을 주입할수있다)
(세가지 종류가 존재하는데 , JDK에 내장된 built-in annotation)
(어노테이션에 대한 정보를 나타내기 위한 meta annotation)
(개발자가 직접 만들어 내는 Custom Annotation)  it with at
and then we have get mapping and so on  
@RestController (annotation) makes this class as a restful 
makes this class to serve rest endpoints

to create a package
main>java>  com.example.demo   >right click >new-package - com.exml.demo.student
we have to pull every code which is student related
how to structure your applications using springboot
in ths packge  create new java class named student

add @GetMapping 
in student.java
create student class  and generate constructor select none , select all , select all except id ,  
and generate getter and setter  ,   toString()
then in demoapplication.java
public List<Student> hello(){
  return List.of(
              new Student(
                  1L,
                  "CJY",
                  "moosou30@gmail.com",
                  24,
                  LocalDate.of(1999,Month.November,16)
                  )
                  )
                }
